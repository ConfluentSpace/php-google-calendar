Preparing this for use:

[Install Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

Install the dependancies with composer

Make [json oauth credentials](https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/php/auth/web-app#creatingcred) following and name the file `.google-secret.json`

Make sure your webserver doesn't serve dot-files!

On the same credentials site create a "Maps Browser Key" and place it in a `.config.php` file. There is an example in this repo.
